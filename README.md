# Despair Change

Despair Change is a donation app that integrates PayPal's REST API to streamline the process of making small donations and displays visuals that communicate to users that their small donations are meaningful. With a few clicks, people can donate to their favorite organizations, increase the footprint of their impact by referring their friends to do the same, and see stats, charts, and graphs that show their donations as a part of a larger collective whole. Registered users can change their default donation amounts, adjust which organization shows up front and center on the donation page, and see their donation history sorted by organization and date. Non registered users can make donations, through the app either directly or via referral link from a registered user. 



## Installation

To install Despair Change on your local machine, pip install -r requirements.txt. In order to make payments/process payments and interact with PayPal's REST API, you must source credentials from PayPal.
